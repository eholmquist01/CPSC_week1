	In Part 2, my program is made to calculate the hypotenuse of a theoretical triangle by asking the user for two integers which will serve as sides to a triangle. I used print statements to prompt the user for input, which also gives the user a brief description of the purpose of the program. I then used scanf for user input and requested only integers. I also made a new variable "c" for the calculation of the hypotenuse, and displayed this with a print statement. 
	I decided to display the answer as a float given that most of the calculations will be irrational (because of the square root). I also used the math.h library for the square root function. 
	To verify correctness, I tested the program by calling it from the directory and used numbers that would give both rational and irrational results. It should work for all numbers; however, note that if you enter double zeros, the program will calculate a hypotenuse of 0. Although entering negative integers may at first be cause for concern, the nature of the Pythagorean Theorem accounts for this by squaring the numbers before taking the square root of their sum.
